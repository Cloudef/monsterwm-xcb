.SH NAME
monsterwm \- minimal and dynamic tiling window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B monsterwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
monsterwm is a very minimal, lightweight, tiny but monsterous, dynamic tiling
window manager with floating mode support. It will try to stay as small as
possible.
.P
.SH MODES
It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers (with the new window as
the master) and with the new window opened at the bottom of the stack
.P
.B monsterwm
three other modes available:
.I Bottom stack
where the slave clients (the smaller "windows") are tiled beneath the master.
.I Grid mode
where, once there are four or more cliens in a workspace, they are all
equally divided into a grid.
.I Monocle mode
or fullscreen mode, where the clients take up the entire workspace, and additional
clients are hidden behind the current shown window.
.I Floating mode
where, windows can move and be resized freely in the screen space. Windows
retain their floating status until the user switches to a tiling mode.
